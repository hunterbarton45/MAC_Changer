# MAC_Changer
This is a mac changer that I created in Kali Linux. It's Python code that works in Python 2.7 and above.
Here is an example of how to change you MAC address with this code. 
sudo python mac_changer.py --interface wlan1 --mac 00:11:22:33:44:55
wlan1 is the interface you want to change followed by the MAC address you want to change to.
for more help in the use python mac_changer.py --help for additional help.
